God's real and get's everything he wants or everything's really for nothing, 
or it's something else entirely i don't know so in that case why even try
well it seems
    0 effort
        cuz i don't really know anything
            can never be sure i'm right
        helps with the truth
            not lying to self for hope
            having time to think i guess
            sane, coordinated state of mind
            ...same way objective thinking works
            and how all effort is deception
            fear ruins everything
        fear ruins everything
        everything's predestined
            all Glory to God
            He knows the beginning and the end
            our brain's are literally made out of deterministic particles, i think
            "our thoughts are automatic" duh
            every man's right in his own sight
                we do everything based on our experience and reasoning, duh
        suffering's constant anyway
            designed to give God glory and enable appreciation and good feelngs
                let every man be a liar, literally making everyone wrong about a lot
                there are vessels of wrath prepared for his destruction
        ...so everything's evil, we want evil, and lie that we don't
        ...so all effort is deception
            all effort is kinda towards existing as a perception of good in a form of memory that will remain
                but that might not be constant
                and we aren't good
                and for that perception of good to have meaning, an opposite, undesired, perception of evil, experience of evil has to exist
                ...so we want evil to exist so our good will be seen
            ...let every man be a liar
                ...we want to exist as good in each other's minds but we aren't good
                    Jesus said so
                    Job said so
